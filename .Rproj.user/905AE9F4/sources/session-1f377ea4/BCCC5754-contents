“DONs.R”

Categories: Statistics, Epidemiology, Diseases

Item type: Software

Keywords: Disease Outbreak News (DONs), the Coronavirus Dashboard, World Health Organization (WHO), Global database, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and related Health Problems, ISO 3166.

Description: R-code to replicate the extraction of data from the Disease Outbreak News (DONs), available at www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news, and the Coronavirus Dashboard, available at https://covid19.who.int/, produced by the World Health Organization (WHO).
