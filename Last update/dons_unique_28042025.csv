Ebola disease is typically characterised by acute onset of fever with non-specific symptoms/signs (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, sore throat) usually followed several days later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and occasionally a variable rash. Hiccups may occur. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, sexual contacts, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk. The incubation period typically is 7–11 days (range ≈2–21 days)."

Early signs typically include fever, hypotension, conjunctivitis, and cutaneous flushing or a skin rash. Later, patients may develop signs of progressive haemorrhagic diathesis, such as petechiae, mucous membrane and conjunctival haemorrhage, haematuria, hematemesis, and melena. Lethality may reach 30%. Transmission occurs via bites of infected ticks, by direct contact with infected animal blood, or iatrogenic transmission. Laboratory diagnosis of the infection during the acute phase of illness consists of detection of viral nucleic acid or by isolation of the virus or by demonstration of viral antigen by enzyme-linked immunoassay from serum or plasma samples. In samples collected later during the illness, diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of specific IgG and IgM antibodies."

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms.

Concomitant fever and arthalgia are a common specific sign although infection can present with non-specific symptoms that can be confused with Dengue including headache, rash and myalgia. Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms.

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection.

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection.

Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity.

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms.

Hiccups may occur. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, sexual contacts, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk.

Marburg disease is typically characterised by acute onset of fever with non-specific symptoms/signs (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, sore throat) usually followed several days later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and occasionally a variable rash. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, sexual contacts, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk. The incubation period typically is 7–11 days (range ≈2–21 days)."

Subsequently, patients develop high fever, extreme lethargy, oedema of head/neck, encephalopathy, pleural effusion, and ascites. Bleeding into the skin, mucosae and underlying tissues occurs in the severest cases. Deafness occurs in many patients, and the disease is often particularly severe in pregnancy. The overall lethality can reach 15% even among hospitalized patients receiving supportive care. Transmission occurs by inhalation, consumption, or direct contact with excretions and bodily fluids from infected rodents. Diagnosis occurs by identification of Lassa virus in blood samples by molecular or serologic methods."

Ebola disease is typically characterised by acute onset of fever with non-specific symptoms/signs (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, sore throat) usually followed several days later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and occasionally a variable rash. Hiccups may occur. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, sexual contacts, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk.

Infection is mild or asymptomatic in most cases, but can cause severe illness or death. After a prodromal period of 7-10 days (sometimes longer), initial symptoms/signs include fever, malaise, headache, sore throat, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. Subsequently, patients develop high fever, extreme lethargy, oedema of head/neck, encephalopathy, pleural effusion, and ascites. Bleeding into the skin, mucosae and underlying tissues occurs in the severest cases. Deafness occurs in many patients, and the disease is often particularly severe in pregnancy. The overall lethality can reach 15% even among hospitalized patients receiving supportive care.

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms.

Early signs typically include fever, hypotension, conjunctivitis, and cutaneous flushing or a skin rash. Later, patients may develop signs of progressive haemorrhagic diathesis, such as petechiae, mucous membrane and conjunctival haemorrhage, haematuria, hematemesis, and melena. Lethality may reach 30%. Transmission occurs via bites of infected ticks, by direct contact with infected animal blood, or iatrogenic transmission. Laboratory diagnosis of the infection during the acute phase of illness consists of detection of viral nucleic acid or by isolation of the virus or by demonstration of viral antigen by enzyme-linked immunoassay from serum or plasma samples. In samples collected later during the illness, diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of specific IgG and IgM antibodies."

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms.

Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, sexual contacts, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk. The incubation period typically is 7–11 days (range ≈2–21 days)."

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection. A small percentage of infected individuals remain asymptomatic, this is more common in patients under 25 years old. Age over 40 years is a risk factor for chronicity of symptoms.

Ebola disease is typically characterised by acute onset of fever with non-specific symptoms/signs (e.g., abdominal pain, anorexia, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, sore throat) usually followed several days later by nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and occasionally a variable rash. Hiccups may occur. Severe illness may include haemorrhagic manifestations (e.g., bleeding from puncture sites, ecchymoses, petechiae, visceral effusions), encephalopathy, shock/hypotension, multi-organ failure, spontaneous abortion in infected pregnant women. Common laboratory findings include thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase concentrations, electrolyte abnormalities, and signs of renal dysfunction. Individuals who recover may experience prolonged sequelae (e.g., arthralgia, neurocognitive dysfunction, uveitis sometimes followed by cataract formation), and clinical and subclinical persistent infection may occur in immune-privileged compartments (e.g., CNS, eyes, testes). Person-to-person transmission occurs by direct contact with blood, other bodily fluids, organs, or contaminated surfaces and materials with risk beginning at the onset of clinical signs and increasing with disease severity. Family members, sexual contacts, healthcare providers, and participants in burial ceremonies with direct contact with the deceased are at particular risk. The incubation period typically is 7–11 days (range ≈2–21 days)."

Free virions are transported via the blood to the liver (hepatocyte apoptosis), muscle, joints and secondary lymphoid organs (adenopathy), wherein the virus replicates. Viral replication is associated with an infiltration of mononuclear cells including macrophages, which underlies the debilitating pain experienced in the muscles and joints, which can persist for months to years post infection.
